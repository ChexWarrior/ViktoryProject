Next Steps:
* Refactor hex drag event to work for any kind of hex (not just initial)
    - Change condition in drag end method to check for this
    - Add new prop to hex that indicates if it can be dragged on at this moment
    - Ensure this prop is switched off when drag is over
    - Rework initial hex reveal by player turn
