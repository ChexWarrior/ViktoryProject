Nex steps:
* Create some kind of container for hex objects in hex drag container,
on board object, so we can get a reference to it during the hex drag events.
Why? So we can gain access to drag svg hex's hex object and use that to build a better
copy method.

Drag Events

1) Drag from container
    * Initial drag event (picking hexes that are randomly revealed)
    * Copy dragged hex to new pos on board, remove hex at old pos and remove hex from container
    * On successful drag to board flip the replacement hex to be a drag target resubscribe to events

2) Drag from board
    * Can only happend after atleast one drag from container
    * Allows player to redrag hexes if they change their minds about position
    * Copy dragged hex to new pos and blank out old hex
